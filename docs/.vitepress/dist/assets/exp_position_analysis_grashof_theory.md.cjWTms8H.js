From the four bar mechanism, different versions of each of them can be obtained by fixing any one of the links p, q, l or s. Such different versions, which can be obtained by fixing any of the different links, are called its &quot;Inversions&quot;. Many a time, a particular inversion of a mechanism may give rise to different mechanisms of practical utility, when the proportions of the link lengths are changed. By this principle of inversion of a fourbar chain, several useful mechanisms can be obtained. Mainly there are three inversions of four bar mechanisms, which are obtained by fixing different links of the kinematic chain as shown in the figure below.
