This lab covers the basic concept of courses on Grashof four bar mechanism, Slider crank mechanism, Scotch Yoke Mechanism, Elliptical Trammel, Tchebichev Straight Line Mechanism, Peaucellier Straight Line Mechanism."

These experiments aims at enhancing the knowledge of students on the different mechanisms, to build mathematical models and develop position, velocity and acceleration relations. After completing every simulation experiment in the mechanics of machines lab the students can able to understand basic concepts on different mechanisms."
