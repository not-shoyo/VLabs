# Position analysis of Grashof four bar mechanism

## Procedure

Read the value of link lengths and the input angle θ2, then use the formulae given below to calculate the value of unknowns θ3, θ4 and γ

For special cases of positioning (e.g. when two link are aligned) use simple geometry and trigonometry relations to find out the solution
